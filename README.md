# Tasks Api

Task api created with Nodejs, Express, and Mongodb as database. It's an api created to meet the needs of a task allocator in a company. In it you can manage users and tasks proposed by an administrator.

## Instructions

First, you have to use Mongodb to create your first user admin. You must create with an information like this

{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"username": "",  // your username<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"password": "",  // your password<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"imgUrl": "",    // your imgurl (upload one manually in /public/images/'name.png' directory)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"names": "",     // your names<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"lastnames": "", // your lastnames<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"role" : "admin" // your role (admin || user)<br>
}<br>

There is no validations, so take care with the information that you upload
